#### By Mark Lawson & Katy Henning

## Description

This application serves as a geography quiz game where the computer names a country and the user must pinpoint that country on the map. Once a user guesses wrong, their score resets. This app is an exercise in modern JavaScript using Node.js and Gulp. Node.js is used to create a local development server, while Gulp manages the project's assets. In addition, the application is styled with Bootstrap and Sass.
